# DSA210-Project  

## Project Overview  

This project explores the relationship between the **World Happiness Index** and **racism** to determine whether levels of discrimination correlate with national happiness scores. Racism and discrimination negatively impact individuals and societies, but to what extent do they influence a country's overall happiness? By analyzing data on racism and comparing it with global happiness rankings, we aim to identify potential patterns and relationships between these two variables.

## Hypothesis  

We hypothesize that **higher levels of racism and discrimination correlate with lower happiness scores in a country**. Societies with greater social inclusivity and lower racial discrimination are expected to have **higher World Happiness Index scores**, as acceptance and equality contribute to better mental health, social trust, and economic stability.  

---

## Objectives  

- Analyze the correlation between racism-related factors and happiness scores globally.  
- Identify trends in countries with high/low racism and their happiness index rankings.  
- Explore possible confounding factors such as GDP, education, and political stability.  
- Provide insights into the societal impact of racism on overall well-being.

## Motivation  

Happiness and well-being are essential indicators of a society's success. While economic factors like GDP influence happiness, **social inclusion, fairness, and human rights** also play a crucial role. By investigating the relationship between racism and happiness, we aim to contribute to discussions on **how discrimination affects societal well-being** and whether reducing racism can improve national happiness.

## Analysis Plan  

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Gather happiness index data and racism-related statistics for multiple countries.  
   - Clean and preprocess datasets for analysis.  

2. **Visualization**  
   - Create scatter plots to compare happiness scores with racism indicators.  
   - Use heatmaps to identify regional trends.  

3. **Hypothesis Testing**  
   - Perform statistical correlation analysis between racism levels and happiness scores.  
   - Apply regression models to determine the impact of racism on happiness.  

4. **Trend Analysis**  
   - Examine trends over timeâ€”does reduced racism lead to increased happiness?  
   - Compare regions with different policies on racial inclusivity.

## Conclusion  

Based on the findings, we will assess whether racism has a **statistically significant impact** on national happiness levels. If the hypothesis is supported, the research could suggest that **reducing racial discrimination may contribute to higher well-being** in societies. The results could also highlight regions where improvements in inclusivity policies may lead to **a more satisfied and happier population**.
