# üìä DSA210-Project: **Happiness & Racism Analysis**  

## üåç Project Overview  

This project explores the **relationship between national happiness levels and discrimination**, focusing on racism, religious bias, and other social exclusion factors.  

By analyzing global happiness rankings alongside discrimination-related statistics, we aim to uncover patterns highlighting how **inclusivity affects societal well-being**. 

  * The idea for this project started from a meme showing that the country rated most racist against Black people and the happiest country was the same: Finland. 

This led me to investigate whether there is a real relationship between discrimination and national happiness, or if this was just a coincidence.

### üîç Key Questions  

- Does higher discrimination correlate with lower happiness levels?(changed because of the results)  
- What are the strongest factors influencing this relationship?  
- Are there **regional differences** in the impact of racism on well-being?  
- Can we build a **predictive model** to estimate happiness using inclusivity metrics?  

These insights can inform **policymakers, educators, and social organizations** seeking to foster more inclusive societies.  

---
## üìà Analysis Plan  

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Import and clean datasets on happiness and discrimination.  
   - Align country naming conventions and handle missing or inconsistent data.  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Normalize discrimination metrics across datasets.  
   - Group countries by region or similarity (e.g., via clustering techniques).  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyze feature distributions and detect outliers.  
   - Use visual tools like heatmaps, bar plots, and scatterplots to explore relationships.  

4. **Statistical Testing**  
   - Conduct correlation analysis using Pearson and Spearman coefficients.  
   - Run permutation and randomized tests to assess statistical significance.  
   - Evaluate whether we can **reject the null hypothesis** with confidence.  

5. **Modeling & Prediction** *(exploratory/future research)*  
   - Apply classification and regression models to predict happiness scores.  
   - Evaluate model performance and analyze feature importance for policy insight.  

---
## üìå Hypothesis  

- **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** There is no significant relationship between discrimination levels and the **World Happiness Index**.  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚Çê):** Higher discrimination correlates with **lower** happiness levels, indicating a negative relationship.

change **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚Çê)** because the relation was there but it was negative unlike previous **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚Çê):** which was positive relation
Statistical tests will determine whether we can reject the null hypothesis and establish a measurable impact of racism on national well-being.  

---

## üéØ Objectives  

- **Quantify** the relationship between happiness and various forms of discrimination.  
- **Identify global trends** among countries with higher or lower exclusion.  
- **Control for confounding factors** such as GDP, governance, and personal freedoms.  
- **Prototype predictive models** of happiness from social metrics.  
- **Deliver actionable insights** to improve inclusivity and national well-being.

üß† **Observation:**  
- Negative correlations between **discrimination and happiness** across all categories.  
- Strongest negative correlation: **Homosexuals (-0.757)** ‚Üí LGBTQ+ exclusion has the highest impact.  
- Race (-0.472) and Religion (-0.462) also show strong negative relationships.  
- High inter-correlation between discrimination factors (e.g., Race & Language: **0.888**) suggests overlapping exclusions.  

---

## üìå Hypothesis Testing  

All **traditional p-values < 0.05**, indicating **statistically significant** correlations.  
However, **permutation test p-values ‚âà 1.00**, which suggests that these relationships are likely **not random**.

### ‚ùå Null Hypothesis Rejected  
‚úÖ Discrimination significantly affects happiness.  
‚ö†Ô∏è But the **correlations are negative**, contradicting any assumption that these exclusions boost happiness.

To find structure in the data without labels, various clustering techniques were used.

---

### üîó Hierarchical Clustering

Uses distance-based dendrograms to iteratively merge similar countries.

![Dendrogram 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/028f0fce-fad4-410c-aad1-5ce8a85b91ff)
![Dendrogram 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42ac5d91-0ed8-4d90-a236-058c96f27911)


**Cluster Sizes**
```
3    18
5    14
4    14
2     8
1     2
6     1
```

---

### üìç K-Means Clustering

K-Means partitions data into `k` groups by minimizing intra-cluster variance.

![KMeans Clusters](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74756bf8-bf93-4d2f-b130-fb4457c8aa24)

**Cluster Optimization**
- **Elbow Method:** k = 2
- **Silhouette Score:** k = 7
- **Chosen k:** `5` (based on visualization & outlier detection)

> üëÄ Data point 20 appeared distant in hierarchical clustering and was best isolated using `k=5`.

---

### üîª Divisive Clustering

This top-down approach begins with all data in one cluster and recursively splits.

## üéØ Conclusion (Updated)

- A **negative correlation** between discrimination and happiness is confirmed ‚Äî **higher discrimination is associated with lower happiness levels**.
- **GDP** (economic strength) has a strong **positive correlation** with happiness but does **not negate the effects of discrimination**.
- **Freedom** also correlates positively with happiness, though its interaction with discrimination is **more nuanced**.
- **LGBTQ+ exclusion** shows the **strongest negative impact** on well-being, marking it as a **key area for policy action**.
- Countries with **inclusive policies and economic stability** consistently rank higher in the **World Happiness Index**.

---

## üåç Implications 

These findings highlight the need for a **multi-dimensional approach** to improving global happiness:

- Implement **policy reforms** that actively reduce discrimination and exclusion.  
- Promote **economic development and good governance** as foundational to well-being.  
- Support **freedom-based initiatives** that uphold individual rights alongside economic progress.  
- Use **intersectional frameworks** to explore how discrimination, wealth, and freedom interact ‚Äî rather than studying these factors in isolation.

---

## üîÆ Next Steps 

- üîé **Explore interactions** between discrimination, GDP, and personal freedom using interaction terms or stratified analysis.  
- üåê **Perform region-specific analysis** to detect differing trends across continents or income groups.  
- üìà **Conduct causal inference** (e.g., regression with controls, instrumental variables, or longitudinal data) to test **causality, not just correlation**.  
- ü§ñ **Enhance predictive models** by integrating both **inclusivity and economic variables** into a unified framework for estimating happiness.
## ü§ñ Machine Learning Summary

To better understand and **model the relationship between discrimination and happiness**, several machine learning techniques were applied:

---

### üî¢ Supervised Learning

- Classification Report showed **balanced performance across classes**.
- A **bias-variance analysis** indicated **k=3** as the optimal value, with the lowest mean squared error.
- Shows promise in distinguishing between countries with higher/lower happiness based on discrimination metrics.

#### üå≥ Decision Trees
- Best `max_depth`: **9**
- Visualized for interpretability.
- Helped highlight the **most influential discrimination features** affecting happiness.

#### üå≤ Random Forests
- Best Parameters: `max_depth=9`, `n_estimators=100`
- Cross-validated Mean Squared Error: **0.7588**
- Performed **feature importance analysis** to rank the factors (e.g., LGBTQ+ bias stood out).
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was used to reduce noise and dimensionality.
  - Optimal number of components: **4**
  - Random Forest with PCA achieved improved CV MSE: **0.3768**

---

### üîç Unsupervised Learning

#### üìä Clustering (Hierarchical, K-Means, Divisive)
- **Hierarchical Clustering** revealed regional and outlier groupings.
- **K-Means**:
  - Elbow method suggested `k=2`, Silhouette method suggested `k=7`.
  - Based on visualization and separation logic, **k=5** was selected as optimal.
- **Divisive clustering** helped detect hidden subgroup structures and isolate countries with unique discrimination profiles.

These models offered **both predictive and explanatory value**, reinforcing earlier statistical insights while helping to **group similar countries**, reduce dimensionality, and **highlight key discriminatory variables** affecting happiness.
