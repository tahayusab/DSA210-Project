# DSA210-Project  

## Project Overview  

This project investigates the relationship between the **World Happiness Index** and **racism**, exploring how levels of discrimination impact national happiness scores. By analyzing global happiness rankings alongside racism-related statistics, we aim to identify patterns that highlight how inclusivity (or lack thereof) affects societal well-being.  

Understanding this relationship can provide insights into **policy-making, economic planning, and social development**, helping to determine whether reducing racism can contribute to a happier society.  

## Key Questions  

- Do countries with lower racism levels tend to have higher happiness scores?  
- What factors contribute most to the correlation between racism and happiness?  
- Are there regional differences in the impact of racism on well-being?  
- Can we build a predictive model to estimate happiness based on social inclusion metrics?  

These findings could offer valuable insights for **policymakers, educators, and social organizations** on the role of discrimination in shaping a nation’s overall happiness.

## Hypothesis  

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no significant relationship between racism levels and the World Happiness Index. Racism and happiness scores are independent of each other.  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ):** Higher racism levels are associated with higher happiness scores, indicating a positive correlation between racism and happiness.  

Through statistical testing, we aim to determine whether we can reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis or if there is insufficient evidence to establish a relationship.

## Objectives  

- **Analyze the correlation** between racism-related factors and happiness scores globally.  
- **Identify trends** in countries with high/low racism and their happiness index rankings.  
- **Explore confounding factors** such as GDP, education, and political stability.  
- **Develop a predictive model** to estimate happiness based on racism and social inclusion indicators.  
- **Provide insights** on how inclusivity policies influence national well-being.

## Motivation  

Happiness and well-being are essential indicators of a successful society. While economic factors like GDP influence happiness, **social inclusion, fairness, and human rights** also play a crucial role.  

By investigating the relationship between racism and happiness, we aim to contribute to discussions on **how discrimination affects societal well-being** and whether reducing racism can improve national happiness. These insights can help **governments, NGOs, and policymakers** make informed decisions to foster more inclusive societies.

## Dataset  

### **Primary Data Sources:**  
1. **World Happiness Index** – [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/)  
2. **Racism-related Data:**  
   - **FBI Hate Crime Statistics** ([link](https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr))  
   - **Eurobarometer surveys on discrimination**  
   - **Pew Research Center** reports on racism and social attitudes  
   - **OECD Indicators on Social Inclusion & Discrimination**  
   - **Global Racism Index (if available from other research sources)**  

We will **merge and clean** these datasets to ensure consistency before conducting any analysis.

## Tools and Technologies  

- **Programming Languages:** Python, R  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Visualization Tools:** Tableau, Power BI  
- **Data Processing:** APIs, CSV/Excel datasets, web scraping

## Analysis Plan  

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Gather happiness index data and racism-related statistics for multiple countries.  
   - Clean and preprocess datasets (handling missing values, ensuring consistency).  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Identify trends in happiness scores vs. racism levels.  
   - Use correlation heatmaps and descriptive statistics.  

3. **Visualization**  
   - Scatter plots to compare happiness scores with racism indicators.  
   - Heatmaps to highlight regional trends.  

4. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - Perform correlation and regression analysis to measure the relationship between racism and happiness.  
   - Test for potential confounding factors (GDP, education, governance).  

5. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Develop a machine learning model to estimate happiness scores based on social inclusion factors.  

6. **Results Interpretation & Documentation**  
   - Summarize findings and highlight key takeaways.  
   - Discuss policy implications based on observed trends.

## Conclusion  

Based on our findings, we will assess whether racism has a **statistically significant impact** on national happiness levels. If the hypothesis is supported, the research could suggest that **reducing racial discrimination may contribute to higher well-being** in societies.  

Additionally, the results could provide valuable insights into **which factors mediate this relationship**, offering recommendations on how governments and institutions can foster a more inclusive and happier society.

## Next Steps  

- **Finalize dataset sources** (Happiness Index, racism-related statistics, demographic factors).  
- **Merge and clean datasets** to ensure consistency and remove missing values.  
- **Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover initial trends.  
- **Run statistical tests** to measure the correlation between racism and happiness.  
- **Develop visualizations** (scatter plots, heatmaps, trend lines) to highlight findings.  
- **Interpret results and document insights** in a research report.  

By the end of this study, we aim to determine **whether reducing racism can positively impact a nation’s happiness levels** and identify key factors influencing this relationship.
