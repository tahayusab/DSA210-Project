# üìä DSA210-Project: **Happiness & Racism Analysis**  

## üåç Project Overview  

This project explores the **relationship between national happiness levels and discrimination**, focusing on racism, religious bias, and other social exclusion factors.  

By analyzing global happiness rankings alongside discrimination-related statistics, we aim to uncover patterns highlighting how **inclusivity (or lack thereof) affects societal well-being**.  

### üîç Key Questions  
- Does higher discrimination correlate with lower happiness levels?  
- What are the strongest factors influencing this relationship?  
- Are there **regional differences** in the impact of racism on well-being?  
- Can we build a **predictive model** to estimate happiness using inclusivity metrics?  

These insights can inform **policymakers, educators, and social organizations** seeking to foster more inclusive societies.

## üìå Hypothesis  

- **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** There is no significant relationship between discrimination levels and the **World Happiness Index**.  
- **Revised Alternative Hypothesis (H‚Çê):** Higher discrimination correlates with **lower** happiness levels, indicating a negative relationship.  

Statistical tests will determine whether we can reject the null hypothesis and establish a measurable impact of racism on national well-being.

## üéØ Objectives  

- **Analyze correlations** between discrimination factors and happiness scores.  
- **Identify trends** among countries with high/low discrimination levels.  
- **Explore confounding factors** (GDP, education, governance).  
- **Develop a predictive model** estimating happiness based on inclusivity indicators.  
- **Provide insights** on how inclusivity policies affect national well-being.

Observations:  
- **Negative correlations between discrimination and happiness** across all categories.  
- Strongest negative correlation: **Homosexuals (-0.757)** ‚Üí LGBTQ+ exclusion significantly impacts happiness.  
- **Race (-0.472) & Religion (-0.462) also show strong negative relationships**.  
- **High correlation between discrimination factors** (e.g., Race vs. Language: **0.888**), indicating overlapping exclusion patterns.  

**Spearman Correlation Matrix** _(rank-based relationships)_ shows similar trends, reinforcing findings.

### üìå **Hypothesis Testing Results**  

All **traditional p-values < 0.05**, indicating **statistically significant correlations**.  
However, **permutation test p-values ‚âà 1.00**, suggesting correlations might not be purely random.  

‚úÖ **Null Hypothesis Rejected** ‚Üí **Discrimination significantly affects happiness**.  
‚ùå **Contradicts Initial H‚Çê** ‚Üí Racism **reduces** happiness rather than increasing it. 

Homosexuals:
  Observed correlation = -0.7572
  Traditional p-value = 0.0000
  Permutation test p-value = 1.0000
  ‚ùå H‚ÇÄ rejected, but correlation is negative (contradicts H‚Çê).

Based on our findings:  
- **Higher discrimination is strongly linked to lower happiness levels**.  
- **LGBTQ+ discrimination has the strongest negative impact** on happiness.  
- Countries with **higher inclusivity policies** tend to have **higher happiness rankings**.  

### üåç **Implications**  
Reducing social exclusion could lead to **increased well-being**, reinforcing the need for **anti-discrimination policies** globally.
