# DSA210-Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to explore whether there is a correlation between the rise of artificial intelligence and the number of Computer Science graduates hired and/or the number of students choosing to study Computer Science.  

My hypothesis is that, as AI technology advances and becomes more accessible, society may perceive AI as a viable alternative to human coders. This perception could lead to a negative correlation between AI’s increasing complexity and accessibility and the number of CS students and professionals being hired.  

To analyze this, I will collect relevant datasets from sources such as **Kaggle**, **Google Dataset Search**, and **YÖK Atlas** ([https://yokatlas.yok.gov.tr](https://yokatlas.yok.gov.tr)). These sources provide data on both AI advancements and trends in hiring and student enrollment in Computer Science programs. For Turkey-specific data, **YÖK Atlas** will be used to analyze trends in CS student enrollment.
