# üìä DSA210-Project: **Happiness & Racism Analysis**  

## üåç Project Overview  

This project explores the **relationship between national happiness levels and discrimination**, focusing on racism, religious bias, and other social exclusion factors.  

By analyzing global happiness rankings alongside discrimination-related statistics, we aim to uncover patterns highlighting how **inclusivity affects societal well-being**.  

---

### üîç Key Questions  

- Does higher discrimination correlate with lower happiness levels?(changed because of the results)  
- What are the strongest factors influencing this relationship?  
- Are there **regional differences** in the impact of racism on well-being?  
- Can we build a **predictive model** to estimate happiness using inclusivity metrics?  

These insights can inform **policymakers, educators, and social organizations** seeking to foster more inclusive societies.  

---
## üìà Analysis Plan  

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Load and preprocess happiness and discrimination datasets.  
   - Handle missing values and harmonize country names for merging.  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Normalize discrimination percentages.  
   - Create regional groups or clusters if applicable.(tried and shown a relation)   

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize distributions and outliers.  
   - Use heatmaps, bar charts, and scatter plots to show relationships.
   

4. **Statistical Testing**  
   - Use Pearson & Spearman correlation to test significance.  
   - Run permutation tests to validate results.  
   - Make randomise testing to say if data shows refuse H0 or unable to refuse H0
   - 
5. **Modeling & Prediction**  (possible future research)
   - Train regression or classification models to predict happiness from exclusion metrics.  
   - Evaluate model accuracy and feature importance.

---
## üìå Hypothesis  

- **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** There is no significant relationship between discrimination levels and the **World Happiness Index**.  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚Çê):** Higher discrimination correlates with **lower** happiness levels, indicating a negative relationship.

change **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚Çê)** because the relation was there but it was negative unlike previous **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚Çê):** which was positive relation
Statistical tests will determine whether we can reject the null hypothesis and establish a measurable impact of racism on national well-being.  

---

## üéØ Objectives  

- **Analyze correlations** between discrimination factors and happiness scores.  
- **Identify trends** among countries with high/low discrimination levels.  
- **Explore confounding factors** (GDP, education, governance).  
- **Develop a predictive model** estimating happiness based on inclusivity indicators.  
- **Provide insights** on how inclusivity policies affect national well-being.

üß† **Observation:**  
- Negative correlations between **discrimination and happiness** across all categories.  
- Strongest negative correlation: **Homosexuals (-0.757)** ‚Üí LGBTQ+ exclusion has the highest impact.  
- Race (-0.472) and Religion (-0.462) also show strong negative relationships.  
- High inter-correlation between discrimination factors (e.g., Race & Language: **0.888**) suggests overlapping exclusions.  

---

## üìå Hypothesis Testing  

All **traditional p-values < 0.05**, indicating **statistically significant** correlations.  
However, **permutation test p-values ‚âà 1.00**, which suggests that these relationships are likely **not random**.

### ‚ùå Null Hypothesis Rejected  
‚úÖ Discrimination significantly affects happiness.  
‚ö†Ô∏è But the **correlations are negative**, contradicting any assumption that these exclusions boost happiness.

while finding k value for clustering i got

Optimal Number of Clusters (Silhouette Score): 7
Final Optimal k: 2
but the graphs showed k=5 ,k=6 is also valid values and also it can be seen that data point 20 is further from all other points in Hierarchichal graph but k=6 gives its own cluster and that was not optical so i choose k=5

## üéØ Conclusion  

- **Higher discrimination = Lower happiness levels**  
- **LGBTQ+ exclusion shows the strongest negative impact**  
- Countries with **inclusive policies** score higher on the happiness index  

---

## üåç Implications  

These findings support global initiatives to:  
- Reduce exclusionary behaviors and policies  
- Promote inclusivity and equal rights  
- Foster well-being through social cohesion  

---

## üîÆ Next Steps  

- üîé Explore **confounding variables** like GDP, education, governance  
- üåê Conduct **regional-focused** analysis  
- ü§ñ Build a **predictive ML model** using inclusivity as a feature
