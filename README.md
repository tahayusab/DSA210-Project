# DSA210-Project

## Project Overview

In this project, I aim to explore whether there is a correlation between the rise of artificial intelligence and the number of Computer Science graduates hired and/or the number of students choosing to study Computer Science. My personal hypothesis is that, since society perceives AI as capable of performing coding tasks, there may be a negative correlation between AI's increasing complexity and accessibility and the number of CS majors and companies hiring CS graduates.

To gather relevant datasets, I plan to search through websites such as **Kaggle**, **Google Dataset Search**, and **YÖK Atlas** ([https://yokatlas.yok.gov.tr](https://yokatlas.yok.gov.tr)), as well as similar sources that provide data on both AI advancements and trends in hiring and student enrollment in Computer Science programs. For Turkey-specific data, **YÖK Atlas** could be a valuable resource for analyzing trends in CS student enrollment.
